## What is SPA ?
- There are three different types of applications in general
  - Static WebSites
  - Dynamic WebSites
  - SPA

### Static WebSites
- In a traditional system, when the browser talks to an URL the whole web page is send to the browser from the back end. The content is stored as an HTML in the server. This reloads the whole screen to reload the content.
### Dynamic WebSites
- In a traditional system, when the browser talks to an URL the whole web page is send to the browser from the back end. The HTML content is generated in the server dynamically. This reloads the whole screen to reload the content.

- In a nutshell, the HTML code is completly built on the server.
- The problem with both the approach is that it is really difficult to build a modern website using the above mentioned style of building websites.

### SPA
- The idea is inspired from Mobile Apps.
- SPA have a sevrer and a client. It just has one HTML file loaded with bunch of JS content loaded and started.As we all know JS runs on a browser.
-  So the idea is the JS code takes care of fetching the data and build the DOM in the browser. So, No server calls in here to reload the HTML.
- Basically no request is sent to the backend to load the retrieve the HTML.

### Why React?
- UI state becomes too difficult handle. Reacts helps taking care of the state of the application.
- React is backed by a Huge community and its pretty easy to find a solution to a problem.
